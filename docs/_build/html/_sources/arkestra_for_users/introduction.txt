The concept of Arkestra
#######################  

Arkestra was conceived as an answer to the problem: **what is the best way for
an organisation to publish information on the web?**

**************************************************
The shortcomings of web content management systems
**************************************************

**Content management systems rarely work very well**, especially when
organisations use them, and the bigger the organisation and the site, the
worse the problems.

Web content management systems waste users' time, and their work, and produce
sites full of inconsistent content, inconsistently presented.

They don't offer users enough freedom to do what they need, and they offer too
much, so they can do things they shouldn't - both at the same time.

Arkestra is an attempt to avoid these pitfalls, by taking a different
approach.

**************************************************
Arkestra's approach
**************************************************

Arkestra **models the real world**, building meaningful real-world relationships
into its structures.

It's a **semantic publishing system** rather than a *content management system*;
it handles **meaningful information**, rather than mere content or data, and makes
as much use as possible of this information as possible.

Arkestra has been designed around a single key imperative: **don't waste
peopleâ€™s time.**

Wherever possible, Arkestra should:

* make it easy to capture and manage useful information
* make the information easily re-usable
* re-use it automatically and appropriately whenever possible 

**************************************************
Arkestra's model of the world
**************************************************

Arkestra begins by modelling the basic concept of an organisation. An
organisation - an **Entity** in Arkestra's terminology - might:

* contain other sub-entities within it 
* occupy a number of buildings across different sites
* have people who have various different roles in it, and engage in different
  activities
* hold events of various kinds
* need to publish news about its activities

... amongst numerous other things.

Arkestra models all of these, and their relationships to each other.

If an entity is a based in a certain building, and that building has a postal
address, Arkestra can work out the correct postal address for the entity. If a
person works in that entity, Arkestra can infer the person's address.

If a particular set of web pages is associated with a particular entity, then
Arkestra will be able to associate other relevant things with those pages -
people, events, news and so on - automatically.

These things can will also be associated with each other in various important
ways in the real world: an event might feature particular people, and take
place at a particular date and time, in a particular location; Arkestra models
and makes use of these relationships too.

The next section will examine entities more closely.
