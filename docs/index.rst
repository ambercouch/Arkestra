These documents are best read at `RTFD <http://readthedocs.org/docs/arkestra/>`_.

Arkestra is an intelligent, semantic web content management system for organisations and institutions.

Arkestra builds on `Django CMS <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_ with modules that handle contacts & people, news & events, 
automatic image publishing and management, maps and more. At the same time it uses a completely standard version of 
Django CMS, and can easily be added to an existing Django CMS installation.

It is flexible, modular and extensible, and has a rich set of automated web publishing tools.

Arkestra was developed at `Cardiff University School of Medicine <http://medicine.cardiff.ac.uk/>`_  to provide a platform for the Schoolâ€™s web presence.

Arkestra can be obtained from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/evildmp/Arkestra>`_.
